## üéØ How to Use This List

- Mark each problem as you solve it.  
- Try to solve in multiple languages (if possible).  
- For each problem, write down:
  - The brute-force solution  
  - The optimized solution  
  - Time & space complexity  
  - Key insights / patterns  

- Revisit the hard ones after a week or two to ensure retention.
